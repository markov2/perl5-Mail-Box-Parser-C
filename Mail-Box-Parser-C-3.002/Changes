Revision history for Perl extension Mail::Box::Parser::C.

The numbers will be sychronized with that of Mail::Box.  When Mail::Box
is upgraded, the old version of Mail::Box::Parser::C may stay valid.

3.002: Wed Aug 27 15:09:46 CEST 2003

	Improvements:

	- Does not depend on Mail::Box anymore, because Mail::Box may
	  required Mail::Box::Parser::C, which results in a
	  cyclic dependency. [Liz Mattijsen]

	 -[Ron Savage] and [Tassilo v Parseval] helped to remove all
	  compiler warnings for Windows C++.

3.001: Aug 6, 2003

	Improvements:

	- Do not complain about lines which look like MBOX separators,
          but which have no year in them.  Needed for broken MBOX
	  applications, like mutt.

	- Bumped version number into very different from MailBox, so
	  people do not think that they are related.

2.034: Tue Jan  7 09:43:40 CET 2003

	Improvements:

	- The requirement of 5.008 can be dropped.

2.033: Tue Dec 24 14:58:12 CET 2002

	Improvements:

	- First implementation (that's an improvement!!!)

0.01  Wed Dec  4 15:01:41 2002
