Revision history for Perl extension Mail::Box::Parser::C.

Mail::Box::Parser::C requires Mail::Box.

version 3.006: Wed Sep 22 14:50:08 CEST 2004

	Interface changes:

	- bodyAsList() now returns a ref-array of lines, in stead of a list
	  of lines.  This is required by MailBox v2.058

	Improvements:

	- new method get_filehandle()

version 3.005: Mon May 31 17:26:23 CEST 2004

	Fixes:

	- Removed recursive dependency for Mail::Box.  Seems unsolvable.
	  [Jeff Squyres] and [Liz Mattijsen]

version 3.004: Mon Apr 5 07:55:52 CEST 2004

	Fixes:

	- Missing dependency for Mail::Box, reported by [anonymous]

	- Added missing LICENSE, thanks to [Tony Bowden]

version 3.003: Thu Aug 28 08:30:26 CEST 2003

	Fixes:

	- Removal of the Mail::Box dependency caused the test to fail!
	  Now only tries to compile itself when Mail::Box is installed.
	  Signaled by [Mike Castle] and [Jeroen Latour]

version 3.002: Wed Aug 27 15:09:46 CEST 2003

	Improvements:

	- Does not depend on Mail::Box anymore, because Mail::Box may
	  required Mail::Box::Parser::C, which results in a
	  cyclic dependency. [Liz Mattijsen]

	 -[Ron Savage] and [Tassilo v Parseval] helped to remove all
	  compiler warnings for Windows C++.

version 3.001: Aug 6, 2003

	Improvements:

	- Do not complain about lines which look like MBOX separators,
          but which have no year in them.  Needed for broken MBOX
	  applications, like mutt.

	- Bumped version number into very different from MailBox, so
	  people do not think that they are related.

version 2.034: Tue Jan  7 09:43:40 CET 2003

	Improvements:

	- The requirement of 5.008 can be dropped.

version 2.033: Tue Dec 24 14:58:12 CET 2002

	Improvements:

	- First implementation (that's an improvement!!!)

version 0.01:  Wed Dec  4 15:01:41 2002
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
		-A Mail::Box::Parser::C
