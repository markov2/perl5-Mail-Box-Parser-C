version 3.002: Wed Aug 27 15:09:46 CEST 2003

	Improvements:

	- Does not depend on Mail::Box anymore, because Mail::Box may
	  required Mail::Box::Parser::C, which results in a
	  cyclic dependency. [Liz Mattijsen]

	 -[Ron Savage] and [Tassilo v Parseval] helped to remove all
	  compiler warnings for Windows C++.

version 3.001: Aug 6, 2003

	Improvements:

	- Do not complain about lines which look like MBOX separators,
          but which have no year in them.  Needed for broken MBOX
	  applications, like mutt.

	- Bumped version number into very different from MailBox, so
	  people do not think that they are related.
